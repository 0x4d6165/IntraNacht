IntraNacht is a purely text-based (abstaining from images or ASCII drawings) role playing game in the style of dungeons and dragons
built as a Linux application with a random story arc and a monetary and health system. The gameplay revolves around various enemies
and situations appearing and the unnamed narrator giving the player several choices and the player types their selection.
The interface is a callback to DOS computing of old with white text on a black background as the only interface. I realize it has a lame story but I wrote it at about 1:00 in the morning.

###Installation
Simply enter: ```gem install intranacht``` into your terminal. If you recieve a permissions error, use: ```sudo gem install intranacht```.
