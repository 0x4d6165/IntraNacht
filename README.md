IntraNacht
==========
IntraNacht is a purely text-based (abstaining from images or ascii drawings) role playing game in the style of dungeons and dragons built as a web app with a dynamic story arc and a monetary and health system. The gameplay revolves around various enemies and situations appearing and the unnamed narrator giving the player several choices and the player types their selection. The interface will be a callback to DOS computing of old with green text on a black background as the only interface.

The game is targeted at lovers of nerd culture and fans of retro computing. What we believes makes this an interesting and novel idea is the general lack of interesting, retro role playing games on the internet and the dark story-line adds inspires interest in the indie game-playing crowd. This is inspired by other games I’ve played the retro aspects stemming from the mobile game Organ Trail and the dark story arc is drawn from the desktop game Thomas was Alone. We plan to use music made by others using Famitracker for audio, and Touch Develop for the source code. 

The game will be funded with donations and/or crowd funding services like Kickstarter. Donators will be rewarded with someform of merchandise like a t-shirt. At the end of this period of we’d like to add different versions of the game with different settings like space or history.
