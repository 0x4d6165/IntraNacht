IntraNacht is a purely text-based (abstaining from images or ASCII drawings) role playing game in the style of dungeons and dragons
built as a Linux application with a random story arc and a monetary and health system. The gameplay revolves around various enemies
and situations appearing and the unnamed narrator giving the player several choices and the player types their selection.
The interface is a callback to DOS computing of old with white text on a black background as the only interface. I realise it has a lame story but I wrote at about 1:00 in the morning.

###Installation
For the moment, you'll either have to take the .rb route of running the game as I haven't figured out how to make a proper .deb file for this yet :(. I apologize for this inconvenience.

Extract the zip file and type:
```
cd /path/to/extracted/folder
```
Then, assuming you have ruby installed, run:
```
ruby intranacht.rb
```
