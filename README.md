IntraNacht is a purely text-based (abstaining from images or ASCII drawings) role playing game in the style of dungeons and dragons
built as a Linux application with a random story arc and a monetary and health system. The gameplay revolves around various enemies
and situations appearing and the unnamed narrator giving the player several choices and the player types their selection.
The interface is a callback to DOS computing of old with white text on a black background as the only interface.

###Installation
For the moment, you'll either have to take the gem or .rb route of running the game as I haven't figured out how to make a proper .deb file for this :(. I apologize for this inconvenience.
####Gem
Make sure you have ruby installed, then run:
```
gem install intranacht
```
You should be able to run 'intranacht' in the terminal. If not, you'll have to adjust your path (I haven't figured out how to do this either :-P).
####.rb
Extract the zip file and type:
```
cd /path/to/extracted/folder
```
Then, assuming you have ruby installed, run:
```
ruby intranacht.rb
```
